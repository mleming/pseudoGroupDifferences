This is a MATLAB script that alters the lambda values in a
number of spherical areas around a NIFTI diffusion tensor
imaging dataset. The purpose of this is to more accurately
test group population tools such as TBSS. To run this, one
simply needs the name of a NIFTI DTI file and a number of
coordinates of the spherical areas that one wants to alter.

This requires that vistasoft be in your MATLAB path:
